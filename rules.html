            <li class="rules-item"><p>Any one line completed will automatically be a winning board, however board stats will be calculated at the end of each game (I'll be watching the games, not tracking stats, so get off my case). This means if someone gets a bingo in the 1st quarter, and someone else gets it in the 4th quarter of the same game, there will be two winners.</p></li>
            <li class="rules-item"><p>The leaderboard will be frozen after the first game in which someone wins.</p></li>
            <li class="rules-item"><p>Pay-outs will ideally work out so at least third place gets their money back, but will ultimately depend on the number of participants.</p></li>
            <li class="rules-item"><p>Tie Breakers for non-winning boards:</p>
                <ul class="tiebreaker-list">
                    <li class="tiebreaker-rule">Closest line to being complete</li>
                    <li class="tiebreaker-rule">The Number of lines that have the same amount of true conditions as the closest line.</li>
                    <li class="tiebreaker-rule">The next closest line to being complete.</li>
                    <li class="tiebreaker-rule">The number of lines with the same amount of true conditions as the next closest line (and so on...)</li>
                    <li class="tiebreaker-rule">Total number of true conditions.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li class="rules-item">Boards can be submitted until 1 PM EST on Sunday, but will not show up in, nor be counted towards the leaderboard until I verify payment ($10 per board, Venmo: @noj_aim) - verification can take place after the deadline.</li>
            <li class="rules-item">Make and play as many boards as you'd like, but if you make more than you pay for, be descriptive about which one(s) you want verified.</li>
            <li class="rules-item">Please inform me of any bugs you encounter, if this crashes the money will be paid back.</li>
